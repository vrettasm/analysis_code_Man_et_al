by α Synuclein"**. Accepted for publication at *Nature Communications*.

## Abstract
---

α-synuclein is a presynaptic protein whose aggregation is associated with the formation of Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s disease.
The functional role of α-synuclein is currently unknown, however, a general consensus is forming on its involvement in the regulation
of neurotransmitter release via binding to synaptic vesicles. In this study we have investigated the interaction of α-synuclein with
the two surfaces of the presynaptic membrane and identified the structural basis of a molecular mechanism enabling this protein to stabilise
in a concentration dependent manner the docking of synaptic vesicles on the inner surface of the membrane. We provide evidence that changes
in the composition of the presynaptic membrane that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases alter the interaction properties of
α-synuclein with the membrane as well as the efficiency by which it stabilises docked synaptic vesicles. Our study identifies the structural
basis of this underlying mechanism and its relevance in the subtle equilibrium between processes involving α synuclein under functional and
pathological contexts.
